This is a monorepo housing:

* **Website**: Public-facing service (Next.js) serving alexisrenderos.com.
* **Platform**: Core back-end service (Node.js) serving GraphQL APIs and interfacing as the database manager.

It's a web app built using:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The website is hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
