[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/63e386ee-88ff-4bd8-b5b3-9b17cc31e851/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/voluble-licorice-1eec99/deploys)

It's a web app built using:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The website is hosted at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
